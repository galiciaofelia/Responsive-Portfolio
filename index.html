      <p>I am Ofelia. I am a woman with a creative mind. Since I can remember, Iâ€™ve been coming up with ideas, projects and goals. This is how I have learned to become a designer. I started making websites eight years ago and with practice I eventually grew to love it and transform that love into a passion in web design. I decided long time ago that building websites was what I wanted to do, so I went first on to self-taught and freelance. For more than a decade I have been helping non-profit organizations to create their presence online. I currently live in Los Angeles California. I create websites, posters, flyers and regularly post about them on my social media.</p>

      <p>I hope you've enjoyed learning a bit about me and please check out my portfolio and visit my social media links.</p>
